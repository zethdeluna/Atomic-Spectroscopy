# Atomic-Spectroscopy
The emission spectra of hydrogen, hydrogen-deuterium, mercury, and sodium have been observed
to be discrete line spectra, meaning that they only emit light at certain wavelengths. In contrast,
there is white light which emits light at all visible wavelengths, a characteristic of a continuous
spectrum. The purpose of this experiment is to observe the spectra of these atoms to confirm
that they are discrete spectra. The wavelengths of emission lines were first calculated by Johann
Balmer, who found a formula to describe the wavelengths of the lines emitted by hydrogen atoms.
We will use the Balmer series wavelengths to determine whether or not we are taking accurate
measurements. As seen from the Bohr atom model, the energy levels of electrons are quantized.
Upon excitation—in this case excitation will be produced using a high voltage—the atoms jump
to higher energy levels. When they jump back to the lower energy level, the energy difference
between the levels is emitted as a photon. Bohr proposed that the energy of the photon is equal to
the difference between the energy of the electron in the excited state and its energy in the ground
state (∆Ephoton = Eexcited − Eground). Later, Albert Einstein determined that the energy of a hc
photon is proportional to its frequency, given by the equation Ephoton = hν = λ . The electrons in different atoms will be excited to different energy levels, resulting in each atom emitting photons at different wavelengths. In this experiment we will be determining the wavelengths of the hydrogen, hydrogen-deuterium, mercury, and sodium spectra.
